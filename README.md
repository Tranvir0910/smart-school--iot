# Smart School Application System

## Description

The Smart School Application System is a project utilizing IoT architecture and platform to develop a simulated application supporting the management of school environments. This application uses sensors to measure air quality and sound environment in schools, and sends alerts when necessary.

The project aims to develop a smart school environment management application with low deployment costs and wide applicability. The application provides functions to support real-time management and device control in classrooms and school premises, collecting environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and noise. It has the capability for automation based on sensor data or user-programmed schedules.

The application also features statistical capabilities to enhance performance and management in a smart school environment.
